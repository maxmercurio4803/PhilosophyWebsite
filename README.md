# PhilosophyWebsite

This website is supposed to make philosophy more accessible to newcomers. It will entail a detailed, chronological list of the history philsophy, including people, ideas, movements, etc. Also, this website will feature discussion threads, allowing people to converse, ask questions, and debate about philosophy.

With philosophy becoming increasingly obsolete, I hope this will be helpful in getting more people interested and invested into Philosophy, as I believe this field is among the most important tools in understanding the world around us.
