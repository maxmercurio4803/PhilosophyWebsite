# PhilosophyWebsite

This website is supposed to make philosophy more accessible to newcomers. It will entail a detailed, chronological list of the history philsophy, including people, ideas, movements, etc. Also, this website will feature discussion threads, allowing people to converse, ask questions, and debate about philosophy.

With philosophy becoming increasingly obsolete, I hope this will be helpful in getting more people interested and invested into Philosophy, as I believe this field is among the most important tools in understanding the world around us.

  The initial commit was comprised of getting the basics of the website down, i.e. just the general functionality of the website, not the aestitic aspects what so ever, which I realize is lacking as of right now.

  I have started with the page for Descartes, which is who I recognize as the most influential figure in the progression of the history of philosophy as of right now (I recognize that this could just be because of the year he was born and the movements occuring as the time, and/or because of his class, privledges, etc.). I plan on expanding next to Hume and Kant, who I see as next most influential figures after Descartes; though, I also plan on going back and making pages for Socrates, Plato, and Aritsotle. I really just want to get the primary figures down and using scripts or another method to add pages for figures that others suggest as the website progresses.
